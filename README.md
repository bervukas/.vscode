# .vscode
This are my Visual Studio Code files for building and debugging C++ projects with latest:
- g++
- clang

# How to start using?
Just drop the entire .vscode folder into the root of your C++ project, and Build tasks 
will show up in your Visual Studio Code.
Then build with Task > Run Task...
